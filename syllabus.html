                <h2>Course Policies</h2>
                <p>It is expected that assignments, unless explicitly stated, are completed individually. Use of AI tools is permitted for coding tasks, provided that you do not plagiarize and that you fully understand, can explain, and take responsibility for any code you submit. AI assistance is NOT allowed for written short-answer questions. Assignments are due at 11:59 PM Eastern Time. Each student is allotted 3 late days that may be used at their discretion across the semester; beyond this allowance, late work will not be accepted without prior approval. Students are also expected to uphold a respectful, inclusive, and professional classroom environment, demonstrating support for their peers and contributing positively to the learning community.</p>
